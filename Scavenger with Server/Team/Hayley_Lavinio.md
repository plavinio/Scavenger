Hey, look! I have a readme file!

My name is Hayley Lavinio. I have experience primarily with Java, C/C++, Scala, and SQL (Postgres), although of the four I'm least comfortable with Scala. I have used Python a little years ago. I also have some experience with micro controllers and the command line. Outside of CS, I've taken some linguistics courses and I love to draw. Through this class I am learning about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and web development.
