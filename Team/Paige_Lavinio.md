# Paige's Info

I am most comfortable in Java, C, SQL (Postgres), and C++, but I also know some Scala, Python, Javascript, CSS, HTML, Node.js etc. I've also worked a little with microcontrollers (Arduino), emacs and the command line. Most of my experience has been with back-end work, but I'm interested in front-end work too.

Outside of Computer Science I enjoy the study of linguistics and I like to draw.
