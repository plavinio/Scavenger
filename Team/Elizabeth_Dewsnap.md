#About me
I am a senior CS major pursuing a BA degree. My other expertise/interests lie in psychology primarily.

#My skills
I have about 7 years of experience with Java, and it's my primary language. C++ comes in a close second, and I also have experience with JavaScript, C, and Python. My most recent project was a Discord bot called VineBot that listens to messages for keywords corresponding to famous Vines and replying with a link to the Vine. This was accomplished primarily in JavaScript.
