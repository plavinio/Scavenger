## Overview:

The goal of this project is to build a virtual lost-and-found application to help reunite people with their lost belongings.
Mainly, users will be able to:
- post a description and/or picture of lost items that they find and where/when they found them
- search for items they may have lost based on a set of search criteria such as place, time, item color, etc.
At the moment our target audience is our local University campus, but in theory it could be expanded to include the whole world.
